Old CPS2Emu that was originally released for the GP2X.
I fixed some issues to get it to work on 32-bits and on the RS-97.
I also discovered that NJEMU shares some code with this one, so it will require some merging.

Unfortunely, sound does not appear to work with neither the OSS code nor the SDL one...
